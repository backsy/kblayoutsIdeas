 # Copied some ideas:
 
 CapsLock+hjkl -> the arrows
 CapsLock+Spacebar -> Return
 CapsLock+ui -> PgUp and PgDn
 CapsLock+yo -> Backspace and Delete
 
 Not sure I need PgUp/Dn... also dvorak hjkl makes no sense alh why start with h? So rather do jkl;.
 
 # My dvorak
 
 Programmers tworak with estonian letters for the accented letters under AltGr+asdfg (looking at US layout). I used nrs with shift+nr row but i feel that sucks. Number row without shift has useful programming symbols. Would like to move both to a separate layer and bring F keys a row lower... or have em on another layer aswell...
 
 A good idea would be a programmable keyboard...
